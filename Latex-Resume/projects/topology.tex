\item Generated AS-level Internet topologies from 10GB+ raw data of Routing Information Base by {\bf Python}. 
\item Evaluated 20k+ AS nodesâ€™ value and computed properties of topologies by {\bf Python} and {\bf MATLAB}. 
\item Accelerated complex properties computation with {\bf CUDA} toolkit on an NVIDIA {\bf GPU}.
