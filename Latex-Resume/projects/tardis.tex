\begin{rSubsection}{Tardis Cluster Big Matrix Computation}{10/2017 - 12/2017}{}{}
\item Developed big matrix computation APIs by {\bf C++}. Optimized performance by cache reuse and register reuse.
\item Deployed back-end on Tardis Cluster which contains 16 computing nodes and a head node, using {\bf OpenMPI}.
\item Accelerated complex computation with {\bf  CUDA-C}.
