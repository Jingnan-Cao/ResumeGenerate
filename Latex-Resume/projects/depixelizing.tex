\item Generated similarity network of pixel by {\bf Python}. Connected similar color pixels with a smooth edge by \emph{networkx}. 
\item Resolved the crossing edges by designed heuristics and reshaped pixel cells, then extracted spline curves. 
\item Rendered vector image output by \emph{svgwrite}.
