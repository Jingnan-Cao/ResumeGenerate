\begin{rSubsection}{3D Render Pipeline \& Ray Tracer}{01/2017 - 02/2017}{}{} 
\item Implemented a 3D rendering pipeline by {\bf C++} under {\bf Linux}, including vertex and viewing transformations, rasterization, interpolation, clipping and using a z-buffer for hidden surface. Verified correctness by {\bf OpenGL}. 
\item Developed a ray tracer by {\bf C++} under {\bf Linux}, including ray generation, ray intersection, shading and reflection.
